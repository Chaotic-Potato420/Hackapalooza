Hi guys!!
A chrome extension requires a background.js file but we won't be doing anything with it so all JavaScript should be done in the popup.js. The manifest.json is what gives the extension the ability to run including permissions, version, title, etc.

HOW TO TEST THE EXTENSION
1. Download the files into one folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions on google
3. Click on the load unpacked button and select the folder with the files you downloaded
4. Then go to the upper right hand corner and select on the icon for our extension and it should run
